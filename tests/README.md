# Sample presentations

`interval_long.scc` and `interval_short.scc` are two interval modules with
matching distance **1**.

```bash
./play tests/interval_long.scc tests/interval_short.scc
./play tests/interval_long.bif tests/interval_short.bif
```

The `.bif` pair is the same comparison as a 1-critical bifiltration: two
vertices at (0, 0) and one edge at the death grade. The \(H_0\) presentation
has two generators at the origin and one relation, so the diagrams also
contain an infinite bar (the connected component). Those infinite bars match
at cost 0; the finite bars still give matching distance 1.

## The modules

Each file is a rank-1 interval: one generator, killed by one relation.

| File | Generator | Relation | Support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `interval_long.scc` | (0, 0) | (2, 2) | $k$ at $x$ iff $(0,0)\le x$ and $(2,2)\not\le x$ |
| `interval_short.scc` | (0, 0) | (1, 1) | same, dying at (1, 1) |

On any affine line $\ell$ of positive slope the slice of an interval is a
single bar, from the push of the birth grade to the push of the death grade.

## Why the matching distance is 1

The matching distance is $\sup_\ell F(\ell)$, where $F(\ell)=w(\ell)\,d_B(M^\ell,N^\ell)$
and $w(\ell)$ is the weight from Kerber–Lesnick–Oudot (so that $F$ measures
distance in the original $L_\infty$ metric on the plane).

On every slice both modules contribute one finite bar, born at the same point
(the push of the origin) and dying at the pushes of (2, 2) and (1, 1). The
bottleneck cost of matching those two bars is the weighted distance between
the two death points. Unmatching both bars cannot cost more than that.

The weighted distance between two grades is at most their $L_\infty$ distance
in the plane, and $\|(2,2)-(1,1)\|_\infty=1$. So $F(\ell)\le 1$ for every
slice.

Equality holds on the diagonal $\ell\colon y=x$ (slope $s=1$, intercept $t=0$):
both death points lie on $\ell$, the weighted grades are 0 (birth), 1 and 2
(deaths), the bars are $(0,2)$ and $(0,1)$, and $d_B=1$. For $s=1$ the
weight times Euclidean factor cancel, so $F=1$.

The same value 1 is the interleaving distance of the two modules: you must
shift by 1 in both coordinates to push (1, 1) onto (2, 2).
